# DEADLOCK `( JAVA Version )`

>>> Deadlock in JAVA is a part of Multi-Threading.
>>> Deadlock can occur in a situation where thread is waiting for an object that is locked, by another thread and second thread is waiting for an object that is locked by first thread.
>>> Since, both threads are waiting for each other to release the lock, that condition is called deadlock.
