# HASHMAP `( JAVA Version )`

>>> It provides basic implementation of Map interface in JAVA.
>>> It stores data in Key-value pairs commonly known as entrySet and you can access value using it's index.
>>> One object is used to store a key (index) and another object (value).
>>> If you try to insert the duplicate key in HashMap, it will replace the element of the corresponding key.
